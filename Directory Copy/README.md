This was a directory copy task that I completed in C#.

Disclaimer: 
I technically didn't pass this task as the company correctly stated that I had used Microsoft's code.
Whilst this is true, I believed that using official code created for a specific task that works exactly as required wouldn't be a problem.
If this is not expected at your organisation, I simply wouldn't do it and would write my own code.
