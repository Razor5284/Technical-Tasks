## Directory Copy

This was a directory copy task that I completed in C#.

### Disclaimer: 

I technically didn't pass this task as the company correctly stated that I had used Microsoft's code.
Whilst this is true, I believed that using official code created for a specific task that works exactly as required wouldn't be a problem.
If this is not expected at your organisation, I simply wouldn't do it and would write my own code.

### Comments:

Re. 1 and 3) I know I needed to have made this using MVC framework but I'm unsure on how it's supposed to be set up.
I couldn't figure this out from scratch as I have had little practice with C#. However, when the framework is set up already, I know what to do with MVC.
Re. 5) I'm not 100% sure as to what "blocking" is; if it's stopping/pausing whilst the file is transferring, I haven't managed to do this point,
but I have an idea on how I'd tackle it, e.g. displaying a progress bar during transfer.
I would also make it hang at the end and give a relevant output to say the operation has been completed.
I hope this is satisfactory to show at least some of my abilities. Total time spent: ~2 hours.
