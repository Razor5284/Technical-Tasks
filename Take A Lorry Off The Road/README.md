# Gousto coding task
Completed as a pair programming exercise within 1 hour (not take-home exercise).

## Take a Lorry off the Road With Some Code!
This [code kata](http://codekata.com/) was inspired by a feature we implemented recently which allowed us to send [1 less lorry out for delivery](https://medium.com/gousto-engineering-techbrunch/taking-a-lorry-off-the-road-with-some-code-a988f70b37c1) every single day! We call this feature **Intelligent Packaging.** We'd like you to build something similar.

### For the pairing exercise, see [PAIRING.md](https://github.com/Gousto/take-a-lorry-off-the-road/blob/master/PAIRING.MD). For the take-home test, see [TAKE_HOME.md](https://github.com/Gousto/take-a-lorry-off-the-road/blob/master/TAKE_HOME.md).
